# Given the following data structure, return a new array containing the same 
# sub-arrays as the original but ordered logically by only taking into 
# consideration the odd numbers they contain.
# The sorted array should look like this:
# [[1, 8, 3], [1, 6, 7], [1, 4, 9]]

arr = [[1, 6, 7], [1, 4, 9], [1, 8, 3]]

new = arr.sort_by do |sub_array|
  sub_array.select do |num|
    num.odd?
  end
end

p new # came up with the same as the book solution
